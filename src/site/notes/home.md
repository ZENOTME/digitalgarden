👋 Hi, I’m ZENOTME, a master’s student in Software Engineering at SJTU.

🎮 My interests include databases, distributed systems, data infrastructure, and operating systems.

💼 I have contributed to various related projects, including a distributed database (_TDSQL_), a streaming database (_RisingWave_), and an open table format (_Iceberg_). You can explore what I’m currently working on through my [GitHub](https://github.com/ZENOTME).
